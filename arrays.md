# A word about "length"

The `length` property automatically updates when we modify the array. To be precise, it is actually not the count of values in the array, but the greatest numeric index plus one.

For instance, a single element with a large index gives a big length.

```javascript
        let fruits = [];
        
        fruits[123] = "Apple";
        
        alert( fruits.length ); //124
```      
     
Another interesting thing about the `length` property is that it's writable.

If we increase it manually, nothing interesting happens. But if we decrease it, the array is truncated. The process is irreversible, hereâ€™s the example:

```javascript
                let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

                arr.length = 2; // truncate to 2 elements
                alert( arr ); // [1, 2]

                arr.length = 5; // return length back
                alert( arr[3] ); // undefined: the values do not return
```                

So, the simplest way to clear the array is: `arr.length = 0;`.
